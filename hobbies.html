                    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>Marlon imagined that hobbies would be pretty hard to come by once he got older. As you can tell by the pictures below that was not the case. Here are pictures from all of his favorite things from a most recent pickleball tournament with a new partner. The newest 4 legged grandkid in the family, Cairo, they go for 2 mile walks a few times a week. Traveling is also a hobby, spending most of the time in Florida and a fun fact, he has racked up over 1 million southwest reward points. He often is in Florida for pickleball and to visit his youngest child who plays college basketball in Florida. Thats just a few of things displayed on this hobby page but the pictures are worth 1000 words.</p>
