                        <h2>About Marlon Polk</h2>
                        <p> Marlon is a successful lawyer and father to 3 kids, Marcus, Jazmine, and Max(who is pictured here). This bio is dedicated to his role as a father. A job such as lawyer often seems like it would be too demanding to have a lot of time for normal fatherly duties. Especially a lawyer at a top firm with constant deadlines and billing requirements. But somehow he managed to be there. He has set a great example for how to work hard and achieve things you never thought was possible. He coached multiple sports such as softball, football, and mainly basketball. </p>
                        <p>As a basketball coach he started his own organization, Youth Dreams, with the goal of making it cheaper and easier for kids of all backgrounds to afford playing such demanding sports. With this organization he started his own basketball tournament that still is operational to this day. It is the largest indoor convention center basketball tournament in the Midwest as it routinely hosts over 250 teams for all over the country that play under 1 roof with 22 courts.</p>
                        <p>With his work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit he is the perfect role model to study. Following in his footsteps have been big as now he has a son who is a business owner, one son that is now playing college basketball, and a daughter who is a lawyer that graduated top of her class.</p>
